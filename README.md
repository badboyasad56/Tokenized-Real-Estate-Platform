# Tokenized Real Estate Platform

A blockchain-based platform for fractional real estate ownership and management, enabling property tokenization, rental income distribution, maintenance management, and decentralized governance.

## Overview

The Tokenized Real Estate Platform consists of four main smart contracts that work together to create a comprehensive solution for managing tokenized real estate assets:

1. Property Token Contract
2. Rental Income Distribution Contract
3. Property Management Contract
4. Voting Contract

## Core Features

### Property Token Contract
- Implements ERC-20 standard for property token creation and management
- Represents fractional ownership of real estate assets
- Supports token transfers, ownership tracking, and balance inquiries
- Includes property metadata storage (location, size, type, etc.)
- Maintains compliance with local securities regulations

### Rental Income Distribution Contract
- Automates rental income collection and distribution
- Calculates proportional earnings based on token ownership
- Supports multiple payment tokens (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Provides detailed distribution reports and history
- Handles tax withholding requirements

### Property Management Contract
- Processes and tracks maintenance requests
- Manages contractor relationships and payments
- Tracks property-related expenses
- Maintains maintenance history
- Implements emergency maintenance protocols

### Voting Contract
- Enables token holder participation in property decisions
- Supports multiple voting mechanisms (simple majority, quadratic, etc.)
- Implements proposal creation and management
- Tracks voting history and results
- Enforces voting power based on token ownership

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Property Token Contract
```solidity
interface IPropertyToken {
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external;
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function getPropertyDetails() external view returns (PropertyDetails memory);
}
```

### Rental Income Distribution Contract
```solidity
interface IRentalIncomeDistribution {
    function distributeIncome() external;
    function claimIncome() external;
    function getUnclaimedIncome(address holder) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

### Property Management Contract
```solidity
interface IPropertyManagement {
    function submitMaintenanceRequest(string calldata description) external;
    function approveRequest(uint256 requestId) external;
    function completeRequest(uint256 requestId) external;
    function getMaintenanceHistory() external view returns (Request[] memory);
}
```

### Voting Contract
```solidity
interface IVoting {
    function createProposal(string calldata description) external;
    function castVote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external;
    function executeProposal(uint256 proposalId) external;
    function getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId) external view returns (Proposal memory);
}
```

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement OpenZeppelin's security standards
- Access control implemented using role-based permissions
- Regular security audits required
- Emergency pause functionality available
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
